:::note

- \* This version is in private preview, which means that future versions might have backward-incompatible updates.
- You can consider the client tools ([ScalarDB Cluster SQL CLI](developer-guide-for-scalardb-cluster-with-java-api.mdx#sql-cli) and [ScalarDB Cluster Schema Loader](developer-guide-for-scalardb-cluster-with-java-api.mdx#schema-loader-for-cluster)) to be the same as the ScalarDB Cluster Java Client SDK. In other words, you can apply the same compatibility rules to client tools as the ScalarDB Cluster Java Client SDK.
- If you use a new feature that ScalarDB Cluster provides in a new minor version, you may need to use the same or a later version of the client tools or re-create (or update) existing schemas. For details, please refer to the relevant documentation about each feature.

## Version skew policy

:::note

Versions are expressed as `x.y.z`, where `x` represents the major version, `y` represents the minor version, and `z` represents the patch version. This format follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

:::

- If the **major** versions are different between ScalarDB Cluster and a client SDK, they are **not** compatible and are **not** supported.
- If the **major** versions are the same and the **minor** versions are different between ScalarDB Cluster and a client SDK, the version of ScalarDB Cluster must be greater than or equal to the client SDK version. For example:
  - **Supported:** Combination of ScalarDB Cluster 3.13 and client SDK 3.11
  - **Not supported:** Combination of ScalarDB Cluster 3.11 and client SDK 3.13
- If the **major** versions and the **minor** versions are the same, you can use different **patch** versions between ScalarDB Cluster and a client SDK. For example:
  - **Supported:** Combination of ScalarDB Cluster 3.13.2 and client SDK 3.13.0
  - **Supported:** Combination of ScalarDB Cluster 3.13.0 and client SDK 3.13.2
