# Run Non-Transactional Storage Operations Overview

ScalarDB was initially designed to provide a unified abstraction between diverse databases and transactions across such databases. However, there are cases where you only need the unified abstraction to simplify your applications that use multiple, possibly diverse, databases.

ScalarDB can be configured to provide only the unified abstraction, without transaction capabilities, so that it only runs non-transactional operations on the underlying database and storage. Since ScalarDB in this configuration doesn't guarantee ACID across multiple operations, you can perform operations with better performance.

In this sub-category, you can learn how to run such non-transactional storage operations.

To learn how to run analytical queries, see the following guides:

- Run Through the CRUD Interface
  - [Use the ScalarDB Core Library](run-non-transactional-storage-operations-through-library.mdx)
  - [Use ScalarDB Cluster](run-non-transactional-storage-operations-through-scalardb-cluster.mdx)
- [Run Through the SQL Interface](run-non-transactional-storage-operations-through-sql-interface.mdx)
- [Run Through the Primitive CRUD Interface](run-non-transactional-storage-operations-through-primitive-crud-interface.mdx)
