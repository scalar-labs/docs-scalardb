# ScalarDB Roadmap

This roadmap provides a look into the proposed future of ScalarDB. The purpose of this roadmap is to provide visibility into what changes may be coming so that you can more closely follow progress, learn about key milestones, and give feedback during development. This roadmap will be updated as new versions of ScalarDB are released.

:::warning

During the course of development, this roadmap is subject to change based on user needs and feedback. **Do not schedule your release plans according to the contents of this roadmap.**

If you have a feature request or want to prioritize feature development, please create an issue in [GitHub](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/issues).

:::

### CY2025 Q3

#### Support for additional databases

- **TiDB**
    - Users will be able to use TiDB as an underlying database through ScalarDB Core and ScalarDB Cluster.
- **AlloyDB**
    - Users will be able to use AlloyDB as an underlying database through ScalarDB Core and ScalarDB Cluster.
- **Spanner**
    - Users will be able to use Spanner as an underlying database through ScalarDB Core and ScalarDB Cluster.

#### New features

- **Decoupled metadata management**
    - Users will be able to start using ScalarDB Cluster without migrating or changing the schemas of existing applications by managing the transaction metadata of ScalarDB in a separate location.
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**
    - Users will be able to define roles and assign permissions to those roles so that users can manage access control in a more flexible way.
- **Views**
    - Users will be able to define views so that they can manage multiple different databases in an easier and simplified way.
- **Addition of SQL operations for aggregation**
    - Users will be able to issue aggregation operations in ScalarDB SQL.
- **Universal catalog**
    - Users will be able to manage metadata, including schemas and semantic information, for operational and analytical databases across separate business domains in a unified manner.
- **Universal authentication and authorization**
    - Users will be able to be given access to ScalarDB Cluster and ScalarDB Analytics by using a unified authentication and authorization method.

#### Improvements

- **Increased BLOB type size for Oracle Database and IBM Db2**
    - Users will be able to use larger BLOB type size in ScalarDB Core and ScalarDB Cluster. The maximum size of the BLOB type will be increased to 4 GB.

#### Usability

- **More flexible ALTER operations**
    - Users will be able to issue more flexible ALTER operations, such as altering schemas, renaming namespaces/tables/columns, and dropping columns, so that they can manage their schemas in a more flexible way.

#### Cloud support

- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) support for ScalarDB Cluster**
    - Users will be able to deploy ScalarDB Cluster in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) in GCP.
- **Container offering in Amazon Marketplace for ScalarDB Analytics**
    - Users will be able to deploy ScalarDB Analytics by using the container offering, which enables users to use a pay-as-you-go subscription model.
- **Red Hat OpenShift support**
    - Users will be able to deploy ScalarDB Cluster in Red Hat OpenShift.

#### AI/LLM support

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server**
    - Users will be able to use the MCP server of ScalarDB Core and ScalarDB Cluster to interact with them by using AI and large language model (LLM) applications. The MCP server will provide a way to communicate with ScalarDB by using natural language, enabling users to perform operations like querying and managing data in a more intuitive manner.
- **LLM-friendly rule files for ScalarDB**
    - Users will be able to ask questions and tasks to LLMs by using the LLM-friendly rule files so that LLMs can work for them with a better understanding of ScalarDB. The rule files will be designed to provide LLMs with the necessary context and instructions to effectively interact with ScalarDB, making it easier for users to leverage AI capabilities in their applications.

### CY2025 Q4

#### New features

- **Native secondary index**
    - Users will be able to define flexible secondary indexes. The existing secondary index is limited because it is implemented based on the common capabilities of the supported databases' secondary indexes. Therefore, for example, users cannot define a multi-column index. The new secondary index will be created at the ScalarDB layer so that users can create more flexible indexes, like a multi-column index.
- **Two-layered query engines**
    - Users will be able to use two-layered query engines to better federate analytical queries across domains. The first-layer query engine is responsible for federating analytical queries across various domains, while the second-layer query engine federates analytical queries within a specific domain across its corresponding databases.

#### Usability

- **Addition of DECIMAL data types**
    - Users will be able to use DECIMAL data types so that users can handle decimal numbers with high precision.
- **Elimination of out-of-memory errors due to large scans**
    - Users will be able to issue large scans without experiencing out-of-memory errors.

#### Support for additional databases (object storage)

- **Azure Blob Storage**
    - Users will be able to use Azure Blob Storage as an underlying database through ScalarDB Cluster.
- **Amazon S3**
    - Users will be able to use Amazon S3 as an underlying database through ScalarDB Cluster.
- **Google Cloud Storage**
    - Users will be able to use Google Cloud Storage as an underlying database through ScalarDB Cluster and ScalarDB Analytics.

#### Performance

- **Reduction of storage space needed for managing ScalarDB metadata**
    - Users will likely use less storage space to run ScalarDB. ScalarDB will remove the before image of committed transactions after they are committed. However, whether or not those committed transactions will impact actual storage space depends on the underlying databases.

#### Cloud support

- **Container offering in Azure Marketplace for ScalarDB Cluster**
    - Users will be able to deploy ScalarDB Cluster by using the Azure container offering, which enables users to use a pay-as-you-go subscription model.
- **Container offering in Google Cloud Marketplace**
    - Users will be able to deploy ScalarDB Cluster by using the Google Cloud container offering, which enables users to use a pay-as-you-go subscription model.

### CY2026

- **Audit logging**
    - Users will be able to view and manage the access logs of ScalarDB Cluster and Analytics, mainly for auditing purposes.
- **Stored procedures**
    - Users will be able to define stored procedures so that they can execute a set of operations with a complex logic inside ScalarDB Cluster.
- **Triggers**
    - Users will be able to define triggers so that they can automatically execute a set of operations when a specific event occurs in ScalarDB Cluster.
- **User-defined functions (UDFs)**
    - Users will be able to define functions so that they can use functions in SQLs to express complex logic in a simpler way.
- **Addition of SQL operations for sorting**
    - Users will be able to issue arbitrary sorting (ORDER BY) operations in ScalarDB SQL for multiple or non-JDBC databases. (Currently, ScalarDB can issue sorting operations using clustering keys or arbitrary sorting operations for single JDBC databases.)
- **Addition of more data types**
    - Users will be able to use complex data types, such as JSON.
