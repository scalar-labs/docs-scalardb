# Monitor ScalarDB by Using Scalar Manager

Scalar Manager is a centralized management and monitoring solution for ScalarDB and ScalarDL within Kubernetes cluster environments that allows you to:

- Check the availability of ScalarDB or ScalarDL.
- Schedule or execute pausing jobs that create transactionally consistent periods in the databases used by ScalarDB or ScalarDL.
- Check the time-series metrics and logs of ScalarDB or ScalarDL through Grafana dashboards.

For more details about Scalar Manager, see [Scalar Manager Overview](scalar-manager/overview.mdx).

## Deploy Scalar Manager

You can deploy Scalar Manager by using a Helm Chart.

For details on how to deploy Scalar Manager, see [How to Deploy Scalar Manager](helm-charts/how-to-deploy-scalar-manager.mdx).
