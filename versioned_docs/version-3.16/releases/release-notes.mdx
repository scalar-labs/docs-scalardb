# ScalarDB 3.16 Release Notes

This page includes a list of release notes for ScalarDB 3.16.

## v3.16.3

**Release date:** December 9, 2025

### Summary

This release mainly consists of several minor bug fixes and small improvements.

### Community edition

#### Improvements

- Added the `scalar.db.active_transaction_management.enabled` configuration option to enable/disable the active transaction management (default: `true`). ([#3233](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/3233))

#### Bug fixes

- On Oracle, when importing a table with a column using the `NUMBER(1)` data type, which is usually used for BOOLEAN data, that column can now be mapped to ScalarDB BOOLEAN by using the ScalarDB Schema Loader `override-columns-type` setting. ([#3239](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/3239))

### Enterprise edition

#### Bug fixes

##### ScalarDB Cluster

- Fixed a bug where the pause functionality did not work correctly when transactions expired.
- Fixed a bug where ScalarDB Cluster cannot be deployed in the Omnistrate environment by upgrading scalar-metering.

## v3.16.2

**Release date:** November 26, 2025

### Summary

This release includes several bug fixes and vulnerability fixes.

### Community edition

#### Enhancements

- Add integration tests for Cassandra 4 and 5. ([#3143](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/3143))

#### Bug fixes

- Fixed `--no-header` option being ignored in data loader CSV exports ([#2924](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2924))
- Upgraded the Cosmos DB library to fix a security issue. [CVE-2025-55163](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-prj3-ccx8-p6x4 "CVE-2025-55163") ([#3105](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/3105))
- Fixed an inconsistency where Get and Scan operations were prepared differently for transaction reads and Serializable validation, which could result in inconsistent ordering and cause Serializable validation failures. ([#3113](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/3113))
- Deprecated `--log-success` argument and introduced a new replacement option `--enable-log-success` ([#3117](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/3117))

## v3.16.0

**Release date:** June 20, 2025

### Summary

This release includes many enhancements, improvements, bug fixes, and performance optimizations.

### Community edition

#### Enhancements

- Added support for IBM Db2 LUV 11 and 12. ([#2598](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2598))
- Added a scanner API to the transaction abstraction for iteratively retrieving results. ([#2729](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2729))
- Added support for scan fetch size in the storage adapters. You can control the number of records fetched by the scan API in the storage layer by configuring the `scalar.db.scan_fetch_size` property. ([#2731](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2731))
- Added `replication-tables` option to the Schema Loader. ([#2747](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2747))
- Added support for beginning transactions in read-only mode. ([#2749](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2749))
- Fixed warnings for Javadoc and errorprone. ([#2614](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2614))
- Introduced `StorageInfo`, which provides metadata about the storage. You can obtain a `StorageInfo` instance via the `DistributedStorageAdmin.getStorageInfo()` method. ([#2756](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2756))
- Added Docker support for the ScalarDB Data Loader CLI, enabling containerized deployment of the data loading functionality. ([#2758](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2758))
- Added a CI workflow for the Data Loader CLI build. ([#2761](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2761))
- Added the `READ_COMMITTED` isolation level, which offers better performance, especially for low-contention workloads. ([#2803](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2803))
- Added support for one-phase commit optimization in Consensus Commit, significantly improving performance by skipping prepare-records and commit-state when all mutations can be committed atomically. Enable this optimization with the `scalar.db.consensus_commit.one_phase_commit.enabled` property. ([#2811](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2811))

#### Improvements

- Made changes so that the ScalarDB BIGINT data type will now be mapped to Oracle's `NUMBER(16)`. ([#2566](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2566))
- Removed the `EXTRA_WRITE` strategy from Consensus Commit. After this change, if the `EXTRA_WRITE` strategy is specified when using Consensus Commit, the `EXTRA_READ` strategy will be used instead. ([#2597](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2597))
- Changed to disallow scan operations after a delete on the same record in Consensus Commit to prevent inconsistent behavior and align with the existing restriction on scans after writes. ([#2610](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2610))
- Changed to omit commit-state for read-only transactions in Consensus Commit to improve performance. This behavior is enabled by default but can be disabled by setting the property `scalar.db.consensus_commit.coordinator.write_omission_on_read_only.enabled` to `false`. ([#2765](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2765))
- Updated the code to remove before images after committing or rolling back records in Consensus Commit to reduce disk usage. ([#2787](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2787))
- Improved the read algorithm in Consensus Commit to reduce unnecessary retries. ([#2798](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2798))

#### Bug fixes

- Upgraded the Netty library to fix a security issue. [CVE-2025-24970](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4g8c-wm8x-jfhw "CVE-2025-24970") ([#2552](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2552))
- Fixed a bug in Consensus Commit with `SERIALIZABLE` isolation level where a transaction consistently aborts if a record was inserted into the scan range after executing a scan with a limit. ([#2621](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2621))
- Fixed an issue with `DistributedStorageAdmin.getNamespaceNames()` API when using the DynamoDB storage with the namespace prefix setting `scalar.db.dynamo.namespace.prefix`. The namespace names returned by this method wrongly contained the prefix. ([#2641](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2641))
- Added exception handling for `DateTimeParseException` on column value conversion ([#2662](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2662))
- Fixed an issue where `Get` operations using secondary indexes could throw `IllegalArgumentException` in `SERIALIZABLE` transactions by converting them to `Scan` operations during validation. ([#2683](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2683))
- Fixed a bug that caused unnecessary implicit pre-reads when updating records retrieved by a secondary-index `Get` operation within a transaction. ([#2700](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2700))
- Fixed minor bugs and issues in Data Loader core. ([#2752](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2752))
- Fixed a bug where records could be missed when executing `Get` or `Scan` with conjunctions in Consensus Commit. ([#2786](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2786))
- Fixed an issue in Consensus Commit where reading the same record multiple times from storage could cause anomalies like lost updates. The read set is no longer updated on repeated reads to resolve this issue. ([#2797](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2797))
- Fixed potential connection leak when using `jdbc` storage and `Scan` operation fails because the target table doesn't exist ([#2766](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2766))
