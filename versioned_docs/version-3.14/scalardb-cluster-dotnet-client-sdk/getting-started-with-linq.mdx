# Getting Started with LINQ in the ScalarDB Cluster .NET Client SDK

The ScalarDB Cluster .NET Client SDK supports querying the cluster with LINQ and some Entity Framework-like functionality.

:::note

This SDK doesn't support [Entity Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/). Instead, this SDK implements functionality that is similar to Entity Framework.

:::

:::note

SQL support must be enabled on the cluster to use LINQ.

:::

## Install the SDK

Install the same major and minor version of the [SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ScalarDB.Client) as ScalarDB Cluster into the .NET project. You can do this by using the built-in NuGet package manager, replacing `<MAJOR>.<MINOR>` with the version that you're using:

```console
dotnet add package ScalarDB.Client --version '<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.*'
```

## Add client settings

Add the `ScalarDbOptions` section to the `appsettings.json` file of your ASP.NET Core app, replacing `<HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS>` with the FQDN or the IP address, and `<PORT>` with the port number (`60053` by default) of your cluster:

```json
{
  "ScalarDbOptions": {
    "Address": "http://<HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT>",
    "HopLimit": 10
  }
}
```

For details about settings files and other ways to configure the client, see [Client configuration](common-reference.mdx#client-configuration).

## Set up classes

After confirming that SQL support is enabled, create a C# class for each ScalarDB table that you want to use. For example:

```c#
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;
using ScalarDB.Client.DataAnnotations;

// ...

[Table("ns.statements")]
public class Statement
{
    [PartitionKey]
    [Column("statement_id", Order = 0)]
    public int Id { get; set; }

    [SecondaryIndex]
    [Column("order_id", Order = 1)]
    public string OrderId { get; set; } = String.Empty;

    [SecondaryIndex]
    [Column("item_id", Order = 2)]
    public int ItemId { get; set; }

    [Column("count", Order = 3)]
    public int Count { get; set; }
}

[Table("order_service.items")]
public class Item
{
    [PartitionKey]
    [Column("item_id", Order = 0)]
    public int Id { get; set; }

    [Column("name", Order = 1)]
    public string Name { get; set; } = String.Empty;

    [Column("price", Order = 2)]
    public int Price { get; set; }
}
```

If a partition key, clustering key, or secondary index consists of more than one column, the `Order` property of `ColumnAttribute` will decide the order inside the key or index.

For details about which types should be used for properties, see [How ScalarDB Column Types Are Converted to and from .NET Types](common-reference.mdx#how-scalardb-column-types-are-converted-to-and-from-net-types).

Create a context class that has properties for all the tables you want to use. For example:

```c#
    public class MyDbContext: ScalarDbContext
    {
        public ScalarDbSet<Statement> Statements { get; set; }
        public ScalarDbSet<Item> Items { get; set; }
    }
```

After all the classes are created, you need to add the created context to the Dependency Injection. For example:

```c#
using ScalarDB.Client.Extensions;

//...

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

//...

builder.Services.AddScalarDbContext<MyDbContext>();
```

The context can be injected into the controller's constructor as follows:

```c#
[ApiController]
public class OrderController: ControllerBase
{
    private readonly MyDbContext _myDbContext;

    public OrderController(MyDbContext myDbContext)
    {
        _myDbContext = myDbContext;
    }
}
```

## Use LINQ to query properties

After receiving `MyDbContext` in your controller, you can query its properties by using LINQ. For example:

### Use query syntax

```c#
from stat in _myDbContext.Statements
join item in _myDbContext.Items on stat.ItemId equals item.Id
where stat.Count > 2 && item.Name.Contains("apple")
orderby stat.Count descending, stat.ItemId
select new { item.Name, stat.Count };
```

### Use method syntax

```c#
_myDbContext.Statements
            .Where(stat => stat.OrderId == "1")
            .Skip(1)
            .Take(2);
```

### Use the `First` method to get one `Statement` by its partition key

```c#
_myDbContext.Statements.First(stat => stat.OrderId == "1");
```

### Use the `DefaultIfEmpty` method to perform left outer join

```c#
from stat in _myDbContext.Statements
join item in _myDbContext.Items on stat.ItemId equals item.Id into items
from i in items.DefaultIfEmpty()
select new { ItemName = i != null ? i.Name : "" }
```

The following methods are supported:

- `Select`
- `Where`
- `Join`
- `GroupJoin`
- `First`/`FirstOrDefault`
- `Skip`
- `Take`
- `OrderBy`/`OrderByDescending`
- `ThenBy`/`ThenByDescending`

The following `String` methods are supported inside the predicates of `Where` and `First`/`FirstOrDefault` methods:

- `Contains`
- `StartsWith`
- `EndsWith`

Unsupported LINQ methods can be used after the supported methods. For example:

```c#
_myDbContext.Statements
            .Where(stat => stat.OrderId == "1") // Will be executed remotely on the cluster.
            .Distinct() // Will be executed locally in the app.
            .Where(stat => stat.ItemId < 5); // Will be executed locally.
```

:::note

If `Skip` is specified before `Take` or `First`/`FirstOrDefault`, the number that is passed to `Skip` will be added to the `LIMIT` number in the SQL query. By itself, `Skip` won't change the resulting SQL query.

:::

## Limitations when using LINQ against `ScalarDbSet{T}` objects

- All method calls are supported inside `Select`. For example:

```c#
.Select(stat => convertToSomething(stat.ItemId))
//...
.Select(stat => stat.ItemId * getSomeNumber())
```

- Method calls, except for calls against the querying object, are also supported inside `Where` and `First`/`FirstOrDefault`. For example:

```c#
.Where(stat => stat.ItemId == getItemId()) // is OK
//...
.Where(stat => stat.ItemId.ToString() == "1") // is not supported
```

- All method calls are supported inside the result-selecting lambda of `Join` and `GroupJoin`. For example:

```c#
.Join(_myDbContext.Items,
      stat => stat.ItemId,
      item => item.Id,
      (stat, item) => new { ItemName = convertToSomething(item.Name),
                            ItemCount = stat.Count.ToString() })
```

- Method calls are not supported inside the key-selecting lambdas of `Join` and `GroupJoin`.
- Custom equality comparers are not supported. The `comparer` argument in `Join` and `GroupJoin` methods will be ignored if the argument has been passed.
- More than one `from` directly in one query is not supported, except when the `DefaultIfEmpty` method is used to perform left outer join. Each subsequent `from` is considered to be a separate query.

```c#
var firstQuery = from stat in _myDbContext.Statements
                 where stat.Count > 2
                 select new { stat.Count };

var secondQuery = from item in _myDbContext.Items
                  where item.Price > 6
                  select new { item.Name };

var finalQuery = from first in firstQuery
                 from second in secondQuery
                 select new { first.Count, second.Name };

// 1. firstQuery will be executed against the cluster.
// 2. secondQuery will be executed against the cluster for each object (row) from 1.
// 3. finalQuery will be executed locally with the results from 1 and 2.
var result = finalQuery.ToArray();
```

- Method calls are not supported inside `OrderBy`/`OrderByDescending` or `ThenBy`/`ThenByDescending`.
- Only overloads of `Contains`, `StartsWith`, and `EndsWith` methods that have a single string argument are supported inside `Where` and `First`/`FirstOrDefault`.

## Modify data in a cluster by using `ScalarDbContext`

The properties of the class inherited from `ScalarDbContext` can be used to modify data.

### Add a new object by using the `AddAsync` method

```c#
var statement = new Statement
                {
                    OrderId = "2",
                    ItemId = 4,
                    Count = 8
                };
await _myDbContext.Statements.AddAsync(statement);
```

### Update an object by using the `UpdateAsync` method

```c#
var statement = _myDbContext.Statements.First(stat => stat.Id == 1);

// ...

statement.Count = 10;        
await _myDbContext.Statements.UpdateAsync(statement);
```

### Remove an object by using the `RemoveAsync` method

```c#
var statement = _myDbContext.Statements.First(stat => stat.Id == 1);

// ...
    
await _myDbContext.Statements.RemoveAsync(statement);
```

## Manage transactions

LINQ queries and `AddAsync`, `UpdateAsync`, and `RemoveAsync` methods can be executed without an explicitly started transaction. However, to execute multiple queries and methods as part of a single transaction, the transaction must be explicitly started and committed. `ScalarDbContext` supports both ordinary transactions and transactions with the two-phase commit interface in ScalarDB.

### Begin a new transaction

```c#
await _myDbContext.BeginTransactionAsync();
```

### Begin a new transaction with the two-phase commit interface

```c#
await _myDbContext.BeginTwoPhaseCommitTransactionAsync();
```

### Get the ID of a currently active transaction

```c#
var transactionId = _myDbContext.CurrentTransactionId;
```

### Join an existing transaction with the two-phase commit interface

```c#
await _myDbContext.JoinTwoPhaseCommitTransactionAsync(transactionId);
```

### Resume an existing transaction

```c#
await _myDbContext.ResumeTransaction(transactionId);
```

### Resume an existing transaction with the two-phase commit interface

```c#
await _myDbContext.ResumeTwoPhaseCommitTransaction(transactionId);
```

:::note

The `ResumeTransaction`/`ResumeTwoPhaseCommitTransaction` methods don't have asynchronous versions because they only initialize the transaction data in the `ScalarDbContext` inheriting object without querying the cluster. Because of this, resuming a transaction by using the wrong ID is possible.

:::

### Commit a transaction (ordinary or two-phase commit)

```c#
await _myDbContext.CommitTransactionAsync();
```

### Roll back a transaction (ordinary or two-phase commit)

```c#
await _myDbContext.RollbackTransactionAsync();
```

### Prepare a transaction with the two-phase commit interface for the commit

```c#
await _myDbContext.PrepareTransactionAsync();
```

### Validate a transaction with the two-phase commit interface before the commit

```c#
await _myDbContext.ValidateTransactionAsync();
```
