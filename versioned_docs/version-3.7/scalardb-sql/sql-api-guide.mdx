# Scalar DB SQL API Guide

This guide describes how to use Scalar DB SQL API.

## SqlSessionFactory

In Scalar DB SQL API, you execute all operations through a `SqlSession` instance, which is instantiated with `SqlSessionFactory`.
This section explains how to use them.

Before explaining `SqlSessionFactory`, we start with the explanation for Connection mode and Transaction mode.

### Connection mode

Scalar DB SQL offers two connection modes: *Direct* and *Server* modes.
With Direct mode, Scalar DB SQL client-side library directly uses Scalar DB API.
On the other hand, with Server mode, Scalar DB SQL client-side library uses Scalar DB API indirectly through Scalar DB SQL Server.

You can specify a connection mode in your configuration file or when you build `SqlSessionFactory`.
And if you don't specify it, Direct mode is used by default.

### Transaction mode

Also, Scalar DB SQL offers two transaction modes: *Transaction* mode and *Two-phase Commit Transaction* mode.
Transaction mode exposes only `commit` interface to users and runs two-phase commit behind the scene, while Two-phase Commit Transaction mode exposes two-phase commit style interfaces (`prepare` and `commit`) to users.

You can specify the default transaction mode in your configuration file or when you build `SqlSessionFactory`.
And you also can change it with the `setTransactionMode()` method of `SqlSession`.

### Build SqlSessionFactory

You have several ways to build `SqlSessionFactory`, as described in the following.

#### Build with a properties file

First, you can build `SqlSessionFactory` with a properties file as follows:

```java
SqlSessionFactory sqlSessionFactory = SqlSessionFactory.builder()
    .withPropertiesFile("<your configuration file>")
    .build();
```

Please see [Scalar DB SQL Configurations](configurations.mdx) for the details of the configurations.

#### Build with the helper methods for Direct connection mode

Other than specifying a properties file, you can build `SqlSessionFactory` with the helper methods of the builder.
An example of Direct connection mode is as follows:

```java
SqlSessionFactory sqlSessionFactory = SqlSessionFactory.builder()
    // Transaction mode. The corresponding property is "scalar.db.sql.default_transaction_mode"
    .withDefaultTransactionMode(TransactionMode.TRANSACTION)
    // Direct connection mode. The corresponding property is "scalar.db.sql.connection_mode"
    .withConnectionMode(ConnectionMode.DIRECT)
    // Enable the statement cache. The corresponding property is "scalar.db.sql.statement_cache.enabled"
    .enableStatementCache()
    // Statement cache size. The corresponding property is "scalar.db.sql.statement_cache.size"
    .withStatementCacheSize(100)
    // The following helper methods are for the underlying storage/database configurations
    // For "scalar.db.storage"
    .withStorage("cassandra")
    // For "scalar.db.contact_points". You can also use addContactPoint()
    .withContactPoint("localhost")
    // For "scalar.db.contact_port"
    .withContactPort(9042)
    // For "scalar.db.username"
    .withUsername("<username>")
    // For "scalar.db.password"
    .withPassword("<password>")
    // For "scalar.db.transaction_manager"
    .withTransactionManager("consensus-commit")
    // If you need custom properties, you can specify them with withProperty() or withProperties()
    .withProperty("<custom property name>", "<custom property value>")
    .build();
```

Please see [Scalar DB SQL Configurations](configurations.mdx) for the details of the Scalar DB SQL configurations.

#### Build with the helper methods for Server connection mode

An example of Server connection mode is as follows:

```java
SqlSessionFactory sqlSessionFactory = SqlSessionFactory.builder()
    // Transaction mode. The corresponding property is "scalar.db.sql.default_transaction_mode"
    .withDefaultTransactionMode(TransactionMode.TRANSACTION)
    // Server connection mode. The corresponding property is "scalar.db.sql.connection_mode"
    .withConnectionMode(ConnectionMode.SERVER)
    // Host name of Scalar DB SQL Server. The corresponding property is "scalar.db.sql.server_mode.host"
    .withServerHost("<Scalar DB SQL Server host>")
    // Port number of Scalar DB SQL Server. The corresponding property is "scalar.db.sql.server_mode.port"
    .withServerPort(60052)
    // If you need custom properties, you can specify them with withProperty() or withProperties()
    .withProperty("<custom property name>", "<custom property value>")
    .build();
```

### Get a SqlSession instance

You can get a `SqlSession` instance with `SqlSessionFactory` as follows:

```java
SqlSession sqlSession = sqlSessionFactory.getSqlSession();
```

Note that `SqlSession` is not thread-safe.
Please don't use it from multiple threads at the same time.

#### Close a SqlSession instance

Once all operations are done with a `SqlSession` instance, you should close the SqlSession instance:

```java
sqlSession.close();
```

### Close a SqlSessionFactory instance

`sqlSessionFactory` should also be closed once it's no longer needed:

```java
sqlSessionFactory.close();
```

## Execute SQLs

You can execute a SQL with `SqlSession` as follows:

```java
ResultSet resultSet = sqlSession.execute("<SQL>");
```

You can also execute a `Statement` object with `SqlSession` as follows:

```java
// Build a statement
Statement statement = StatementBuilder.<factory method>...;

// Execute the statement
ResultSet resultSet = sqlSession.execute(statement);
```

`Statement` objects can be built by `StatementBuilder` that has factory methods for corresponding SQLs.
Please see [the Javadoc of `StatementBuilder`](https://scalar-labs.github.io/scalardb-sql/javadoc/core/com/scalar/db/sql/builder/StatementBuilder.html) and [Scalar DB SQL Grammar](grammar.mdx) for more details.

### Handle ResultSet objects

As the result of the SQL execution, `SqlSession` returns a `ResultSet` object.
Here, we describe how to handle `ResultSet` objects.

If you want to get results one by one from the `ResultSet` object, you can use the `one()` method as follows:
```java
Optional<Record> record = resultSet.one();
```

Or, if you want to get results all at once as a `List`, you can use the `all()` method as follows:
```java
List<Record> records = resultSet.all();
```

Also, as `ResultSet` implements `Iterable`, you can use it in a for-each loop as follows:

```java
for (Record record : resultSet) {
    ...
}
```

If you want to get the metadata of the `ResultSet` object, you can use the `getColumnDefinitions()` method as follows:

```java
ColumnDefinitions columnDefinitions = resultSet.getColumnDefinitions();
```

Please see [the Javadoc of `ColumnDefinitions`](https://scalar-labs.github.io/scalardb-sql/javadoc/core/com/scalar/db/sql/ColumnDefinition.html) for more details.

### Handle Record objects

As mentioned, a `ResultSet` object returns `Record` objects that represent records of the database.

You can get a column value of a result with `getXXX("<column name>")` or `getXXX(<column index>)` methods (XXX is a type name) as follows:

```java
// Get a Boolean value of a column
boolean booleanValueGottenByName = record.getBoolean("<column name>");
boolean booleanValueGottenByIndex = record.getBoolean(<column index>);

// Get an Int value of a column
int intValueGottenByName = record.getInt("<column name>");
int intValueGottenByIndex = record.getInt(<column index>);

// Get a BigInt value of a column
long bigIntValueGottenByName = record.getBigInt("<column name>");
long bigIntValueGottenByIndex = record.getBigInt(<column index>);

// Get a Float value of a column
float floatValueGottenByName = record.getFloat("<column name>");
float floatValueGottenByIndex = record.getFloat(<column index>);

// Get a Double value of a column
double doubleValueGottenByName = record.getDouble("<column name>");
double doubleValueGottenByIndex = record.getDouble(<column index>);

// Get a Text value of a column
String textValueGottenByName = record.getText("<column name>");
String textValueGottenByIndex = record.getText(<column index>);

// Get a Blob value of a column (as a ByteBuffer)
ByteBuffer blobValueGottenByName = record.getBlob("<column name>");
ByteBuffer blobValueGottenByIndex = record.getBlob(<column index>);

// Get a Blob value of a column as a byte array
byte[] blobValueAsBytesGottenByName = record.getBlobAsBytes("<column name>");
byte[] blobValueAsBytesGottenByIndex = record.getBlobAsBytes(<column index>);
```

And if you need to check if a value of a column is null, you can use the `isNull("<column name>")` or `isNull(<column index>)` method.

``` java
// Check if a value of a column is null
boolean isNullGottenByName = record.isNull("<column name>");
boolean isNullGottenByIndex = record.isNull(<column index>);
```

Please see also [the Javadoc of `Record`](https://scalar-labs.github.io/scalardb-sql/javadoc/core/com/scalar/db/sql/Record.html) for more details.

### Prepared Statements

You can use `PreparedStatement` for queries that are executed multiple times in your application:

```java
PreparedStatement preparedStatement = sqlSession.prepareStatement("<SQL>");
ResultSet result = preparedStatement.execute();
```

If you execute the same query a second time or later, the cached pre-parsed statement object is used.
Thus, you can gain a performance advantage with `PreparedStatement` when you execute the query multiple times.
If you execute a query only once, a prepared statement is inefficient because it requires extra processing.
Consider using the `sqlSession.execute()` method instead in that case.

Also, you can use `PreparedStatement` with bind parameters.
Parameters can be either positional or named:

```java
// Positional parameters
PreparedStatement preparedStatement1 =
    sqlSession.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO tbl (c1, c2) VALUES (?, ?)");

// Named parameters
PreparedStatement preparedStatement2 =
    sqlSession.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO tbl (c1, c2) VALUES (:a, :b)");
```

You can set parameters first and execute it:

```java
// Positional setters
preparedStatement1
    .setInt(0, 10)
    .setText(1, "value")
    .execute();

// Named setters
preparedStatement2
    .setInt("a", 10)
    .setText("b", "value")
    .execute();
```

Please see also [the Javadoc of `PreparedStatement`](https://scalar-labs.github.io/scalardb-sql/javadoc/core/com/scalar/db/sql/PreparedStatement.html) for more details.

## Execute transactions

In Scalar DB SQL, you can execute DML statements (SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) only in transactions.
So before executing DML statements, you must begin a transaction.

Note that you cannot execute statements other than DML statements transactionally.
So even if you execute a non-DML statement after beginning a transaction, it is executed immediately, and it doesn't affect the transaction you have begun.

This section describes how to execute a transaction for each transaction mode: Transaction mode and Two-phase Commit Transaction mode.

### Transaction Mode

An example code for Transaction mode is as follows:

```java
try {
  // Begin a transaction
  sqlSession.begin();

  // Execute statements (SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) in the transaction
  ...

  // Commit the transaction
  sqlSession.commit();
} catch (TransactionConflictException e) {
  // If you catch TransactionConflictException, it indicates conflicts happen during a
  // transaction so that you can retry the transaction in your application

  // Rollback the transaction
  sqlSession.rollback();
} catch (UnknownTransactionStatusException e) {
  // If you catch UnknownTransactionStatusException when committing the transaction, you are not
  // sure if the transaction succeeds or not. In such a case, you need to check if the
  // transaction is committed successfully or not and retry it if it failed. How to identify a
  // transaction status is delegated to users
} catch (Exception e) {
  // If you catch an exceptions other than the above, it indicates that an unexpected failure
  // happens, so you should cancel or retry the transaction after the failure/error is fixed

  // Rollback the transaction
  sqlSession.rollback();
}
```

If you catch `TransactionConflictException`, it indicates conflicts happen during a transaction so that you can retry the transaction, preferably with well-adjusted exponential backoff based on your application and environment.

If you catch `UnknownTransactionStatusException` when committing the transaction, you are not sure if the transaction succeeds or not.
In such a case, you need to check if the transaction is committed successfully or not and retry it if it fails.
How to identify a transaction status is delegated to users.
You may want to create a transaction status table and update it transactionally with other application data so that you can get the status of a transaction from the status table.

If you catch an exception other than the above, it indicates that an unexpected failure happens, so you should cancel or retry the transaction after the failure/error is fixed.

### Two-phase Commit Transaction Mode

Before reading this, please read [this document](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/blob/master/docs/two-phase-commit-transactions.md) to learn the concept of Two-phase commit transactions.

To begin a transaction for a coordinator, you can do as follows:

```java
String transactionId = sqlSession.begin();
```

And to join a transaction for participants, you can do as follows:

```java
sqlSession.join(transactionId);
```

An example code of Two-phase Commit Transaction mode is as follows:

```java
try {
  // Begin a transaction
  sqlSession.begin();

  // Execute statements (SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) in the transaction
  ...

  // Prepare the transaction
  sqlSession.prepare();

  // Validate the transaction
  sqlSession.validate();

  // Commit the transaction
  sqlSession.commit();
} catch (TransactionConflictException e) {
  // If you catch TransactionConflictException, it indicates conflicts happen during a
  // transaction so that you can retry the transaction in your application

  // Rollback the transaction
  sqlSession.rollback();
} catch (UnknownTransactionStatusException e) {
  // If you catch UnknownTransactionStatusException when committing the transaction, you are not
  // sure if the transaction succeeds or not. In such a case, you need to check if the
  // transaction is committed successfully or not and retry it if it failed. How to identify a
  // transaction status is delegated to users
} catch (Exception e) {
  // If you catch an exceptions other than the above, it indicates that an unexpected failure
  // happens, so you should cancel or retry the transaction after the failure/error is fixed

  // Rollback the transaction
  sqlSession.rollback();
}
```

The exception handling is the same as Transaction mode.

## Get Metadata

You can get metadata with the `SqlSession.getMetadata()` method as follows:

```java
Metadata metadata = sqlSession.getMetadata();
```

Please see [the Javadoc of `Metadata`](https://scalar-labs.github.io/scalardb-sql/javadoc/core/com/scalar/db/sql/metadata/Metadata.html) for the details.
