# Develop Overview

In this category, you can follow guides to help you become more familiar with ScalarDB, specifically with how to run transactions, analytical queries, and non-transactional storage operations.

To get started with developing applications for ScalarDB, see the following sub-categories.

## Run transactions

In this sub-category, you can learn how to model your data based on the ScalarDB data model and create schemas. Then, you can learn how to run transactions through the ScalarDB Core library and ScalarDB Cluster, a gRPC server that wraps the Core library.

For an overview of this sub-category, see [Run Transactions Overview](develop-run-transactions-overview.mdx).

## Run analytical queries

## Run non-transactional operations

In this sub-category, you can learn how to run such non-transactional storage operations.

For an overview of this sub-category, see [Run Non-Transactional Operations Overview](develop-run-non-transactional-operations-overview.mdx).

## Run sample applications

In this sub-category, you can learn how to run various sample applications that take advantage of ScalarDB.

For an overview of this sub-category, see [Run Sample Applications Overview](scalardb-samples/README.mdx).
