import WarningLicenseKeyContact from '/src/components/_warning-license-key-contact.mdx';

ScalarDB, as a universal transaction manager, targets mainly transactional workloads and therefore supports limited subsets of relational queries.

ScalarDB Analytics with Spark extends the functionality of ScalarDB to process analytical queries on ScalarDB-managed data by using Apache Spark and Spark SQL.

Since ScalarDB Analytics with Spark is provided as a Spark catalog plugin, you can read externally managed data sources with its data schema. By using this plugin, you can read data from ScalarDB tables as Spark SQL tables with the same schema.
