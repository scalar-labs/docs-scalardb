# Welcome to the Jekyll config file for Scalar product documentation!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect the entire site for this set of Scalar parent product docs. 
# After initially setting up this parent product docs site, the values in this config file should rarely be edited. 
# If edits are needed to this config file, you may need to consider editing the config files of other Scalar parent product docs sites so that we can ensure consistency.
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use `jekyll serve`. 
# If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# When adding versioned docs, add a new config file in the root folder of the repository, with a base URL containing the product and version in the following format: `_config.<PARENT_PRODUCT_NAME>.<X.X.X>`
