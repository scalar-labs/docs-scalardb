# Run Transactions Overview

In this sub-category, you can learn how to model your data based on the ScalarDB data model and create schemas. Then, you can learn how to run transactions through the ScalarDB Core library and ScalarDB Cluster, a gRPC server that wraps the Core library.

To learn how to create correct, secure, and well-performing ScalarDB-based applications, see the following guides:

- [Model Your Data](data-modeling.mdx)
- Run Through the CRUD Interface
  - [Use the ScalarDB Core Library](run-transactions-through-scalardb-core-library.mdx)
  - [Use ScalarDB Cluster](scalardb-cluster/run-transactions-through-scalardb-cluster.mdx)
- [Run Through the SQL Interface](scalardb-cluster/run-transactions-through-scalardb-cluster-sql.mdx)
