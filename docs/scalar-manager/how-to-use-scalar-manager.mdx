# How to Use Scalar Manager

Scalar Manager is a centralized management and monitoring solution for ScalarDB and ScalarDL in Kubernetes environments. It simplifies operational tasks by providing a graphical user interface (GUI) that combines functionalities previously managed through separate command-line tools and third-party solutions.

This guide explains how to use Scalar Manager to monitor, manage, and maintain your ScalarDB and ScalarDL deployments.

:::note

For instructions on how to set up and configure Scalar Manager in your environment, see [Deploy Scalar Manager](../helm-charts/getting-started-scalar-manager.mdx).

:::

## System requirements

Scalar Manager is a web-based application that can be accessed from the following supported web browsers:

- Google Chrome (latest version)
- Mozilla Firefox (latest version)
- Microsoft Edge (latest version)
- Safari (latest version)

For the best experience:

- Ensure that you have JavaScript enabled.
- Confirm that you're connected to your Scalar Manager instance.
- Disable pop-up blockers for the application domain.

:::note

This application is designed for desktop and tablet browser use. While it may load on mobile devices, functionality is not guaranteed or supported at this time.

:::

## User authentication

This section describes how to log in, manage your password, and use single sign-on (SSO) in Scalar Manager.

### How to log in to Scalar Manager

1. In a web browser, open the Scalar Manager link that your system administrator provided.
2. In the **Email** field, enter your email address.
3. In the **Password** field, enter your password and select **Log In**. After logging in, you'll be redirected to the dashboard.

:::note

If you see an error message, double-check your email address and password, and try again.

### How to use SSO with Grafana

Scalar Manager provides seamless authentication with Grafana by using your existing credentials. With SSO integration, you can access any Grafana dashboard directly through the Scalar Manager interface. Authentication happens automatically when using your Scalar Manager credentials.

:::note

- SSO integration requires proper configuration by your system administrator.
- If you encounter login prompts, please contact your system administrator.

## User roles

This section describes the roles that you can assign to users in Scalar Manager.

### Available roles and permissions

The system has three fixed roles that cannot be extended or customized:

| Administrator | Full system access        |
| Writer        | Cluster management access |
| Reader        | View-only access          |

### Role-based feature access

Understanding which features are available to each role helps in assigning appropriate roles to users:

| Feature                  | Administrator | Writer | Reader |
|--------------------------|---------------|--------|--------|
| User Management          | ✅            | –      | –      |

3. Assign a role to the newly created user by doing the following:
   1. Fill in the user information (name, email address, and password).
   2. In the **Role** dropdown menu, select one of the three roles:
     - Administrator
     - Writer
     - Reader
   3. Select **Add User** to create the user with the assigned role.

#### 2. Modifying an existing user's role

1. Go to the user list by selecting the **Users** menu item under **Admin Settings**. You'll see a list of all users in the system.
2. Select the user whose role you want to modify. A sidebar will appear that shows the user's current information.
3. In the **Role** dropdown, select the new role that you want to assign the user.
4. Select **Save Changes** to apply your changes.

### Creating a new user

1. **Access the user management page**
   - Click on the `Users` menu item in the admin settings at the bottom of the page
   - You'll be taken to the user list page
2. **Using the user list**

## Log management

This section describes how to access logs and pause and resume clusters.

### How to access logs

To access the logs dashboard:

1. Select **Logs** in the side menu.

- Analyze historical log data.

![grafana-logs-dashboard](images/logs.png)

## Pausing and resuming clusters

Pausing is a process that temporarily stops new transactions from being accepted to ensure transactional consistency during operations like backups. This helps maintain data integrity by ensuring that all transactions are completed before the operation begins.

For detailed information about pausing and when to use it, see [How to Back Up and Restore Databases Used Through ScalarDB](https://scalardb.scalar-labs.com/docs/latest/backup-restore).

### How to execute a pausing job immediately

To execute a pausing job immediately:

1. Go to **Backup & Restore**.
2. Select **Create Pauses**.
3. Select the namespace from the dropdown menu.
4. Select the release from the dropdown menu.
5. Select **Execute**. This will pause all jobs in the release.

![execute-pause-page](images/execute-pause.png)

### How to schedule pausing jobs

1. Go to **Backup & Restore**.
2. Select **Create Pauses**.
3. Select **+ Schedule**. A pop-up window will appear for you to configure the schedule.
4. Select the namespace and release from the dropdown menus.
5. Choose the scheduling type (Daily, Weekly, or Monthly).
6. Set the time parameters (hour and minutes), timezone, and pause duration.
7. Select **Schedule** to create the schedule.
   - To discard the schedule, select **Cancel**.

![schedule-pause-popup](images/schedule-pause-popup.png)

### How to view and manage scheduled pauses

Pausing jobs appear in the scheduled pause job list.

To see the list of scheduled pausing jobs:

1. Go to **Backup & Restore**.
2. Select **Scheduled Pauses**. The list will display all scheduled pausing jobs with details such as namespace, release name, product, component, schedule time, timezone, and pause duration.

To delete a scheduled pausing job:

1. Select **Delete** next to the scheduled pausing job.
2. Confirm the deletion when prompted.

You can see specific pausing jobs by:

- Using the search bar to find scheduled pauses by keyword.
- Filtering the list by namespace or release.

![schedule-pauses-page](images/schedule-pauses.png)

### How to check pause results

The Check Pauses page shows the results of executed pauses, providing information about when pauses were executed properly:

1. Go to **Backup & Restore**.
2. Select **Check Pauses**. The Check Pauses page is a read-only page that displays the results of executed pausing jobs, with details including namespace, release, start/end times, and timezone.

You can see specific pausing jobs by:

- Using the search bar to find scheduled pauses by keyword.
- Filtering the list by namespace or release.

:::note

This page shows only the results of pauses that have been executed. To [schedule a pausing job](#how-to-schedule-pausing-jobs) or [execute a pausing job](#how-to-execute-a-pausing-job-immediately), you need to go to the Create Pauses page as described in the previous sections.
