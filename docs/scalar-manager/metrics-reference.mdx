# Scalar Manager Metrics Reference

This document provides a list of explanations for all metrics available in Scalar Manager, via Grafana, to help you monitor the performance, health, and operational status of your ScalarDB and ScalarDL deployments.

## Understanding the metrics

Before exploring the specific metrics, it's important to understand how they are measured:

- **Rate metrics (per one second):** These metrics measure the frequency of operations, indicating how many times a specific operation occurs each second.
- **Execution time metrics (percentile):** These metrics measure how long operations take to complete, presented as percentiles (p50, p90, p99). Execution times are measured in milliseconds. For example:
  - **p50 (median):** 50% of operations complete faster than this time
  - **p90:** 90% of operations complete faster than this time
  - **p99:** 99% of operations complete faster than this time

Higher percentile values (especially p99) help identify worst-case performance scenarios that might affect user experience even when average performance seems acceptable.

In the tables below, related rate and execution time metrics are grouped together for clarity.
