## v3.15.1

**Release date:** February 20, 2025

### Summary

This release includes numerous enhancements, improvements, and bug fixes. The [3.15.0 release](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/releases/tag/v3.15.0) has been discarded, making this the first official release for 3.15.

### Enhancements

- Introduced operation attributes, providing the capability to include additional key-value information in operations. ([#2333](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2333))
- Add the new time-related data types DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP, and TIMESTAMPTZ. ([#2468](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2468) [#2491](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2491))

### Improvements

- ScalarDB now supports MySQL 8.4, 8.0; PostgreSQL 17, 16, 15, 14, and 13; Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL 16, 15, 14, and 13; Amazon Aurora MySQL 3, and 2. ([#2302](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2302))
- Use the MariaDB Connector/J JDBC driver for any connection URL starting with `jdbc:mariadb` ([#2391](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2391))
- Removed unnecessary loggings in the statement handlers for Cassandra and Cosmos DB. ([#2469](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2469))

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where the scan with a limit doesn't work correctly when the scan results exceed 1 MB and require multiple requests to DynamoDB. ([#2291](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2291))
- Added validation for primary key columns in the Cosmos DB adapter. The validation ensures that the text values of the primary key columns do not contain illegal characters (`:`, `/`, `\`, `#`, and `?`). ([#2292](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2292))
- Fixed the behavior of multiple mutations for the same record in a transaction in Consensus Commit. ([#2340](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2340))
