# Getting Started with ASP.NET Core and Dependency Injection in the ScalarDB Cluster .NET Client SDK

The ScalarDB Cluster .NET Client SDK supports Dependency Injection in frameworks like ASP.NET Core.

## Install the SDK

Install the same major and minor version of the [SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ScalarDB.Client) as ScalarDB Cluster into the .NET project. You can do this by using the built-in NuGet package manager, replacing `<MAJOR>.<MINOR>` with the version that you're using:

```console
dotnet add package ScalarDB.Client --version '<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.*'
```

## Add client settings

Add the `ScalarDbOptions` section to the `appsettings.json` file of your ASP.NET Core app, replacing `<HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS>` with the FQDN or the IP address, and `<PORT>` with the port number (`60053` by default) of your cluster:

```json
{
  "ScalarDbOptions": {
    "Address": "http://<HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT>",
    "HopLimit": 10
  }
}
```

For details about settings files and other ways to configure the client, see [Client configuration](common-reference.mdx#client-configuration).

## Set up the transaction managers

You can register the ScalarDB Cluster transaction managers as services in `IServiceCollection` as follows:

```c#
using ScalarDB.Client.Extensions;

//...

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

//...

builder.Services.AddScalarDbCluster();
```

After registering the transaction managers, they can be injected into the controller's constructor as follows:

```c#
[ApiController]
public class OrderController: ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IDistributedTransactionManager _manager;
    private readonly ISqlTransactionManager _sqlManager;
    private readonly ITwoPhaseCommitTransactionManager _twoPhaseManager;
    private readonly ISqlTwoPhaseCommitTransactionManager _sqlTwoPhaseManager;
    private readonly IDistributedTransactionAdmin _admin;

    public OrderController(IDistributedTransactionManager manager,
                           ISqlTransactionManager sqlManager,
                           ITwoPhaseCommitTransactionManager twoPhaseManager,
                           ISqlTwoPhaseCommitTransactionManager sqlTwoPhaseManager,
                           IDistributedTransactionAdmin admin)
    {
        _manager = manager;
        _sqlManager = sqlManager;
        _twoPhaseManager = twoPhaseManager;
        _sqlTwoPhaseManager = sqlTwoPhaseManager;
        _admin = admin;
    }
}
```

Although these examples are for WebApi projects, the examples will work in a similar way in GrpcService projects.
