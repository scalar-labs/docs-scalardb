# Getting Started with ScalarDB Auth by Using ScalarDB Cluster .NET Client SDK

The ScalarDB Cluster .NET Client SDK supports [ScalarDB Auth](../scalardb-cluster/scalardb-auth-with-sql.mdx), which allows you to authenticate and authorize your requests to ScalarDB Cluster.

## Install the SDK

Install the same major and minor version of the [SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ScalarDB.Client) as ScalarDB Cluster into the .NET project. You can do this by using the built-in NuGet package manager, replacing `<MAJOR>.<MINOR>` with the version that you're using:

```shell
dotnet add package ScalarDB.Client --version '<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.*'
```

## Set credentials in the settings file

You need to set credentials in the settings file as follows, replacing the contents in the angle brackets as described:

```json
{
  "ScalarDbOptions": {
    "Address": "http://<HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT>",
    "HopLimit": 10,
    "AuthEnabled": true,
    "Username": "<USERNAME>",
    "Password": "<PASSWORD>"
  }
}
```

For details about settings files and other ways to configure the client, see [Client configuration](common-reference.mdx#client-configuration).

## Get a transaction manager

You need to get a transaction manager or transaction admin object by using `TransactionFactory` as follows. Be sure to replace `<GET_TRANSACTION_MANAGER>` with `GetTransactionManager()`, `GetTwoPhaseCommitTransactionManager()`, `GetSqlTransactionManager()`, or `GetSqlTwoPhaseCommitTransactionManager()`.

```c#
// Pass the path to the settings file.
var factory = TransactionFactory.Create("scalardb-options.json");

// To get a transaction manager
using var manager = factory.<GET_TRANSACTION_MANAGER>();

// To get a transaction admin
using var admin = factory.GetTransactionAdmin();
```

A transaction manager or transaction admin object created from `TransactionFactory` with the provided credentials will automatically log in to ScalarDB Cluster and can communicate with it.

## Wire encryption

[Wire encryption](../scalardb-cluster/scalardb-auth-with-sql.mdx#wire-encryption) is also supported. It can be turned on by setting `Address` to the URL starting with `https` as follows:

```json
{
  "ScalarDbOptions": {
    "Address": "https://<HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT>"
  }
}
```

For details about settings files and other ways to configure the client, see [Client configuration](common-reference.mdx#client-configuration).
